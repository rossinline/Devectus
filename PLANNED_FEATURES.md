# All Planned Features

## Desired Features
- Dyanamic React Component/application reload when interactions occur i.e. once a new component is added the component area is refreshed to show the new component instantly
- Dynamic search that shows available results automatically based on active input
- Greater code processing/output capabilities (currently only HTML, CSS, JavaScript); This could be implimented using Monaco editors perhaps (open to suggestions)
- Code cleanups and optimisations

## Future Feature Ideas
- Better responsivness for all devices (styling)
- Drag adjustible sections i.e. organising widths of component container or code details area
- Timestamps on components automatically ("Date created", "Date Modified")
- Fully custom styled code-mirror areas to match dark/light themes (code editor)
- Animations and transitional effects (styling)
- More selectable themes
- Connecting the application to an extention in VS code to more easily add component code into projects
- Obsidian intergration/compatibility to connect a component to notes
