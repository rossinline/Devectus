> [!CAUTION]
> This Project is at a fairly early stage of development, and is one of our first attempts at opensourcing a project

An Offline Component library app that allows developers to save code snippets and components on the local drive. No complexities, a simple paste of code saved for later use.

## Contents
- [Our Goals](#our-goals)
- [Current Features](#current-features)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [Installation and Getting Started](#installation-and-getting-started)
- [Using The Application](#using-the-application)

## Our Goals
- To make the reusing of code components easier for developers.
- To keep developers code creations safe and 100% offline.
- To increase project development efficiencies.
- To keep it simple, no AI or LLM enhancements to promote privacy "peace of mind".
- Keep the design clean, and modern.

## Current Features
- Add a component with; **name**, **tags** (Max of 3 right now), **languages** (Max of 3 right now) and **code input boxes**
- Edit a component; **name**, **tags**, **languages** and **code input boxes**
- Delete a component
- Pin components
- Select components to display all info inputted by user
- Search components by name or tags
- Recent tags area for better access to components
- Langauges tags area for list of 5 langauges in the library of components
- Settings area with Dark and Light Themes for app
- App Refresh button
- Automatically assigned code logos for components from "Devicons"

## Contributing
We have plenty of features, ideas, and some issues to work on (see Issues), if you think you could contribute, Check out the CONTRIBUTING.md area and let us know!

## Desired Features
- Dyanamic React Component/application reload when interactions occur i.e. once a new component is added the component area is refreshed to show the new component instantly
- Dynamic search that shows available results automatically based on active input
- Greater code processing/output capabilities (currently only HTML, CSS, JavaScript); This could be implimented using Monaco editors perhaps (open to suggestions)
- Code cleanups and optimisations
- Better File and Folder Structure

## Future Feature Ideas
- Better responsivness for all devices (styling)
- Drag adjustible sections i.e. organising widths of component container or code details area
- Timestamps on components automatically ("Date created", "Date Modified")
- Fully custom styled code-mirror areas to match dark/light themes (code editor)
- Animations and transitional effects (styling)
- More selectable themes
- Connecting the application to an extention in VS code to more easily add component code into projects
- Obsidian intergration/compatibility to connect a component to notes

See all planned features here

 _We are always open to more suggestions that align with the project goals_

## Installation and Getting Started
As of right now, the project is only available to install from this GitHub Repository -

Please ensure your NodeJS Version is **v20.15.1** or later 

**Follow the guide at [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project)**

> [!CAUTION]
> We are currently unaware of the cross-compatibility of this application on Operating Systems other than Windows 11, please let us know of any issues you may find!

## Using the application

 - ### Adding a Component
    Once Devectus is started and open, you can begin by creating a new component by selecting the "Add" button in the tools area, follow the on screen form instructions to create your component.

  - ### Select and view the component information
    Click on a component in the component list/area to display all information inputted for that selected component, including name, tags, langauges and the code inputted, as well as an output (HTML, CSS and JavaScript only).

  - ### Edit a component
    You can edit component information by selecting a component and then selecting the "Edit" button in the tools area, then make changes in the form accordingly.

  - ### Delete a component
    You can delete a component by selecting a component and then selecting the "Delete" button in the tools area, then click confirm deletion.

  - ### Pin a component
    You can Pin components that you may see as more important by selecting the component then selecting the "Pin" button in the tools area.

  - ### Search for a component
    You can search for a component by typing your search into the search bar above the tools buttons/area and selecting the search icon or pressing the "Enter" key.

  - ### Change application theme
    Select the settings button in the top left of the application, then select the preferred theme (Light/Dark).

  - ### Refresh the application
    Select the refresh button next to the logo in the top left of the application and the newly created component should appear.
> [!NOTE]
> We hope to soon impliment automatic refreshing or a dynamic refresh in certain React Components to replace the need to refresh with the button.
